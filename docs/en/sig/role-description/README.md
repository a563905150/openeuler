**Note**: Contributors should actively take part in code review and if they'd like to help more, strive to be a *Committer* of SIG.

## Committer

Committers can review the quality and correctness of code in SIG or some parts of SIG. Committers should have a good knowledge of code repository and software engineering principles.

**Definition**：*developer* entry in the OWNERS file owned by each SIG.

+  **Distribute and deal with problems**:Please refer to [问题处理流程]() .
+  **Tracking dependency issues**：In the development branch, software package's dependencies in the SIG may be broken due to the software package updates in other SIG. At this time, the Committer will receive an alert. Then, the committer should try to rebuild the software package. Because dependency problem may prevent users from updating the system, the build team will also participates in rebuilding packages that have dependency issues, but the Maintainer should not rely on these works.
+  **Notify SIG that may be affected due to interface changes**：Because other SIGs or projects rely on software package of this SIG, changes to the package interface may affect them. Maintainer should review the dependency impact caused by decision changes. Then Maintainer should announce and send alert emails of API or ABI changes.

         For further information, please refer to [上游社区软件包管理建议]()
+  **Collaborate with test team** including:
   +  When you submit the software packages, the information how to debug and classify the packages should be provided to QA for problem classification
   +  Provide basic functional test cases for regression testing
   +  When you update the software package, the test cases related to fixed problems in the update package should be provided to QA


## Maintainer

Maintainer is the leader of SIG group or member of management Committee, and also the maintainer of software package. They can review and approve code like committers.
