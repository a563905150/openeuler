>-   The root password must be set during the installation. Otherwise, the installation fails.  
>-   A root account is used for performing critical system administrative tasks. It is not recommended to use this account for daily work or system access  
>-   When setting the password of user  **root**  or that of a new user, you are strongly advised to set the password according to the password complexity requirements. When you set a weak password \(the password does not meet the complexity requirements\), the system generates an alarm and asks you whether to use the weak password. If you enter  **yes**, the weak password is forcibly set. However, the weak password poses security risks. Exercise caution when selecting a weak password. For details about the recommended password complexity, see the "Password Complexity" part in  **Installation Guide \> Installation in GUI Mode \> Configurations During Installation**.
