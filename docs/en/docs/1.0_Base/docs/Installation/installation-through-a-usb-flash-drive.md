# Installation Through a USB Flash Drive<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0229291281"></a>

This section describes how to create or use a USB flash drive to install the openEuler.

## Preparing the Installation Source<a name="en-us_topic_0022605797_en-us_topic_0018374843_section16523819201222"></a>

Pay attention to the capacity of the USB flash drive. The USB flash drive must have sufficient space to store the entire image. It is recommended that the USB flash drive has more than 16 GB space.

1.  Connect the USB flash drive to the system and run the  **dmesg**  command to view related log. At the end of the log, you can view the information generated by the USB flash drive that is just connected. The information is similar to the following:

    ```
    [ 170.171135] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk
    ```

    >Take the  **sdb**  USB flash drive as an example.  

2.  Switch to user  **root**. When running the  **su**  command, you need to enter the password.

    ```
    $ su - root
    ```

3.  Ensure that the USB flash drive is not mounted. Run the following command:

    ```
    # findmnt /dev/sdb
    ```

    -   If no command output is displayed, the file system is not mounted. Go to the next step.
    -   If the following information is displayed, the USB flash drive is automatically mounted.

        ```
        # findmnt /dev/sdb
        TARGET   SOURCE   FSTYPE  OPTIONS
        /mnt/iso /dev/sdb iso9660 ro,relatime
        ```

        In this case, you need to run the  **umount**  command to uninstall the device.

        ```
        # umount /mnt/iso
        ```

4.  Run the  **dd**  command to write the ISO image to the USB flash drive.

    ```
    # dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/device bs=blocksize
    ```

    Replace  **/path/to/image.iso**  with the complete path of the downloaded ISO image file, replace  **device**  with the device name provided by the  **dmesg**  command, and set a proper block size \(for example, 512 KB\) to replace  **blocksize**  to accelerate the write progress.

    For example, if the ISO image file name is  **/home/testuser/Downloads/openEuler-1.0-base-aarch64-dvd.iso**  and the detected device name is  **sdb**, run the following command:

    ```
    # dd if=/home/testuser/Downloads/openEuler-1.0-base-aarch64-dvd.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k
    ```

5.  After the image is written, remove the USB flash drive.

    No progress is displayed during the image write process. When the number sign \(\#\) appears again, the write is complete. Exit the  **root**  account and remove the USB flash drive. In this case, you can use the USB flash drive as the installation source of the system.


## Starting the Installation<a name="en-us_topic_0022605797_en-us_topic_0018374843_section61839653201222"></a>

Perform the following operations to start the installation:

>![](./public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>Set the system to preferentially boot from the USB flash drive. Take the BIOS as an example. You need to move the  **USB**  option under  **Boot Type Order**  to the top.  

1.  Disconnect all drives that are not required.
2.  Open your computer system.
3.  Insert the USB flash drive into the computer.
4.  Restart the computer system.

After a short delay, a graphical wizard page is displayed, which contains different boot options. If you do not perform any operation within one minute, the installation program automatically starts the installation.
