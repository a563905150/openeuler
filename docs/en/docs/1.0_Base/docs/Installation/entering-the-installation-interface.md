# Entering the Installation Interface<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0214071139"></a>

After the installation program starts, the main installation configuration interface is displayed, as shown in  [Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0186390094_en-us_topic_0122145883_fig5969171592212). On the interface, you can configure the time, language, installation source, network, and storage device.

Some configuration items are matched with safety symbols. A safety symbol will disappear after the item is configured. Start the installation only when all the safety symbols disappear from the interface.

If you want to exit the installation, click  **Exit**. The message "Are you sure you want to exit the installation program?" is displayed. Click  **Yes**  in the dialog box to go back to the installation wizard page.
