### Storage Configuration

On the  **INSTALLATION DESTINATION**  page, configure storage for system partition. You can either manually configure partitions or select  **Automatic**  to automatically configure partitioning.

>![](./public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>-   During partitioning, to ensure system security and performance, you are advised to divide the device into the following partitions:  **/boot**,  **/var**,  **/var/log**,  **/var/log/audit**,  **/home**, and  **/tmp**.  
>-   If the system is configured with the swap partition, the swap partition is used when the physical memory of the system is insufficient. Although the swap partition can be used to expand the physical memory, if the swap partition is used due to insufficient memory, the system response slows and the system performance deteriorates. Therefore, you are not advised to configure the swap partition in the system with sufficient physical memory or the performance sensitive system.  
>-   If you need to split a logical volume group, select  **Custom**  to manually partition the logical volume group. On the  **MANUAL PARTITIONING**  page, click  **Modify**  in the  **Volume Group**  area to reconfigure the logical volume group.  

**Automatic**

Select  **Automatic**  if the software is installed in a new storage device or the data in the storage device is not required.

**Customize**

If you need to manually partition the disk, click  **Customize**  and click  **Done**  in the upper left corner. The following page is displayed.

**Figure  14**  MANUAL PARTITIONING page<a name="fig1277151815248"></a>  
![](./figures/manual-partitioning-page.png "manual-partitioning-page")

On the  **MANUAL PARTITIONING**  page, you can partition the disk in either of the following ways:

-   Automatic creation: Click  **Click here to create them automatically**. The system automatically assigns four mount points according to the available storage space:  **/boot**,  **/**,  **/boot/efi**, and  **swap**.
-   Manual creation: Click  ![](./figures/en-us_image_0229291243.png)  to add a mount point. It is recommended that the expected capacity of each mount point not exceed the available space.

    >![](./public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >If the expected capacity of the mount point exceeds the available space, the system allocates the remaining available space to the mount point.  


After the setting is complete, click  **Done**  in the upper left corner to go back to the  **INSTALLATION SUMMARY**  page.

## Setting the Network and Host Name

On the  **INSTALLATION SUMMARY**  page, select  **NETWORK & HOST NAME**  to configure the system network functions.

The installation program automatically detects a local access interface. The detected interface is listed in the left box, and the interface details are displayed in the right-hand area, as shown in  [Figure 15](#en-us_topic_0186390264_en-us_topic_0122145831_fig123700157297).

**Figure  17**  Installation process<a name="en-us_topic_0186390266_en-us_topic_0122145909_fig1590863119306"></a>  
![](./figures/installation-process.png "installation-process")

During the process of installing software packages, you need to configure the root password and create users.

### Password Complexity

The password of the  **root**  user or the password of the new user must meet the password complexity requirements. Otherwise, the password configuration or user creation will fail. The password complexity requirements are as follows:

1.  A password must contain at least eight characters.
2.  A password must contain at least three of the following types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
3.  A password must be different from the account name.
4.  A password cannot contain words in the dictionary.
    -   Querying a dictionary

        In the installed openEuler environment, you can run the following command to export the dictionary library file  **dictionary.txt**, and then check whether the password is in the dictionary.

        ```
        cracklib-unpacker /usr/share/cracklib/pw_dict > dictionary.txt
        ```

    -   Modifying a dictionary
        1.  Modify the exported dictionary library file, and then run the following command to update the dictionary library:

            ```
            # create-cracklib-dict dictionary.txt
            ```

        2.  Run the following command to add another dictionary file  **custom.txt**  to the original dictionary library.

            ```
            # create-cracklib-dict dictionary.txt custom.txt
            ```




### Setting the Root User Password

Click  **Root Password**. In the displayed dialog box, as shown in  [Figure 18](#en-us_topic_0186390266_en-us_topic_0122145909_fig1323165793018), enter a password and re-enter to confirm.

>![](./public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
>The root password is required to be configured at the same time of installing software packages. Otherwise, the installation will fail. A  **root**  account is used for performing critical system administration tasks. It is not recommended to use this account for daily work or system access.  

**Figure  18**  Password of the  **root**  account<a name="en-us_topic_0186390266_en-us_topic_0122145909_fig1323165793018"></a>
