# Docker Container

Docker is an open-source Linux container engine that enables quick application packaging, deployment, and delivery. The original meaning of Docker is dork worker, whose job is to pack the goods to the containers, and move containers, and load containers. Similarly, the job of Docker in Linux is to pack applications to containers, and deploy and run applications on various platforms using containers. Docker uses Linux Container technology to turn applications into standardized, portable, and self-managed components, enabling the "build once" and "run everywhere" features of applications. Features of Docker technology include: quick application release, easy application deployment and management, and high application density.
