# System Container


System containers are used for heavyweight applications and cloud-based services in scenarios with re-computing, high performance, and high concurrency. Compared with the VM technology, system containers can directly inherit physical machine features and has better performance and less overhead. In addition, system containers can be allocated more computing units of limited resources, reducing costs. Therefore, system containers can be used to build differentiated product competitiveness and provide computing unit instances with higher computing density, lower price, and better performance.
