# iSulad Container Engine


Compared with Docker, iSulad is a new container solution with a unified architecture design to meet different requirements in the CT and IT fields. Lightweight containers are implemented using C/C++. They are smart, fast, and not restricted by hardware and architecture. With less noise floor overhead, the containers can be widely used.

[Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0182207099_fig10763114141217)  shows the unified container architecture.
